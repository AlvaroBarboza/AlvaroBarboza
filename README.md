# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Álvaro

## About Me  

🚀 Data Professional with over 2 years of experience, specializing in translating complex analyses into process optimization and systemic impact.  

🔧 Skilled in **SQL, Python, and Power BI**, I move beyond standard analysis to build data pipelines, automate tasks, and identify the root causes of operational issues. 

🤖 I also have experience with Machine Learning Development, where I collaborated on building a Generative AI bot to adjudicate fraud cases in bulk, based on rules and conditions from its internal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

🎓 Currently, I'm studying **Analysis and Systems Development with a focus on Data Engineering** at Cruzeiro do Sul University to expand my technical knowledge.
